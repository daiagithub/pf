grails-oauth vesion 2.x is a ground-up rewrite of the previous plugin (< 1.x), with a number of small differences in its set-up.

This quick guide will attempt to make the transition as seamless as possible.

h2. Configuration

The configuration block's structure remains mainly the same, with the important changes documented below

{table}
*Old Configuration Directive* | *New Configuration Directive*
requestTokenUrl               | Replaced with 'api' directive, see [3. Further Configuration]
accessTokenUrl                | Replaced with 'api' directive, see [3. Further Configuration]
authUrl                       | Replaced with 'api' directive, see [3. Further Configuration]
consumer.key                  | key
consumer.secret               | secret
{table}

{note}
The plugin does not currently support multiple consumers, it is recommended to set up multiple providers with different names if you need this functionality.

h2. In the view layer (GSP)

The oauth link tag has become much more simplified:

{code}
<g:oauthLink consumer='myConsumer'
             returnTo="[controller: 'myController', action: 'oauthComplete']">Authorize</g:oauthLink>
{code}

becomes simply

{code}
<oauth:connect provider="myConsumer">Authorize</oauth:connect>
{code}

{note}
The 'returnTo' directive above has been moved into your configuration as 'successUri' and 'failureUri'. See [3. Further Configuration] for further details.
{note}

h2. Accessing oauth protected resources

Accessing resources is now done via convention rather than configuration, so the following block of code

{code}
def response = oauthService.accessResource(url: 'http://api.url', consumer: 'twitter',
    token:[key: 'accesskey', secret: 'accesssecret'], method: 'POST')
{code}

can be implemented as

{code}
def response = oauthService.postTwitterResource(twitterAccessToken, 'http://api.url')
{code}

where 'Twitter' is the provider name, twitterAccessToken is an instance of @org.scribe.model.Token@ and the second parameter is the url of the oauth protected resource you are trying to access.
